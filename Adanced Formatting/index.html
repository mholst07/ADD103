        <h3>Killer Whales</h3>

        <p>
          Killer Whales, known as Orcas, are large marine animals that are
          colored black and white. They live in the cold waters. They are
          extremely powerful, intelligent, quick, agressive, and creative. They
          eat fish and lots of other marine animals in the sea.

        <h3>Seals</h3>

        <p>
          Seals are mammals that also live in the cold waters. They are colored
          in gray, silver, white, black, and brown. Though they always look
          sleak and wet, when they are dry they are covered in fluffy furr. They
          eat fish, shrill, and squid. Mostly just large amount of fish.

      <h4>Seal and Orca Predator/Prey Relationship</h4>
      <p id="relationship">
        A seal and an orca have one of the most fascinating — and tense —
        relationships in the ocean. Though both are marine mammals, their roles
        in the food chain couldn’t be more different. The orca, also known as
        the killer whale, is a top predator — powerful, intelligent, and highly
        social. Orcas often hunt in pods, using teamwork and strategy to catch
        their prey. One of their favorite foods? Seals. For the seal, this makes
        orcas both terrifying and awe-inspiring. Seals are quick, agile
        swimmers, and they rely on sharp instincts and the safety of ice floes
        or rocky shores to escape predators. When an orca approaches, seals must
        act fast — slipping into the water to hide beneath the ice, or
        scrambling onto land where the orca can’t reach. But there’s more to
        their relationship than just predator and prey. Scientists have observed
        how orcas’ hunting behaviors shape seal populations and influence where
        seals live and breed. In turn, seals play a role in maintaining the
        balance of fish and other marine life, which affects the orcas’ food
        sources, too. In short, the seal and the orca share a relationship
        defined by survival, strategy, and respect — a natural dance of hunter
        and hunted that has shaped life in the ocean for millions of years. -
