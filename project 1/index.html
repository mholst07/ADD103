          I am 18 years old. This is my first year at McHenry County College. I
          am getting my Associates Degree in Graphic Design. This website is
          about my hobbies and who I am in a nutshell.

          This is my family! My dad's name is Adam, my mom is Julie, and my
          brother is William. I am very thankful for them because they are
          always there for me no matter what, they always find a way to make me
          laugh, they are kind, loving, and no one can replace them. Without
          them my life wouldn't be complete.
