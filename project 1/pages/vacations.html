        <h2>Florida Trip</h2>
        <p>
          In 2024, my family and I went to Florida. It was my favorite vacation
          I have ever been on. We lived at the beach the entire time, we met a
          kind family that taught us how to fish in the ocean, saw manatees and
          sharks swimming by us, ate at seafood restaurants, swam in the pool,
          and walked around exploring Florida.

        <h2>Beach Sunset</h2>
        <p>
          When I am on vacation I hate when the day ends, but Florida made it
          exciting. Every night there was a beautiful, bright sunset that lit up
          the night sky. Sunsets are my favorite.
