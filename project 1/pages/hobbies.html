        <h2>Fishing</h2>
        <p>
          Fishing is something that I always grew up doing. It is such a fun,
          relaxing activity to do but it can be hard waiting along time for a
          fish to come along. It's more fun when you're fishing on a boat or a
          canoe, rather than a peer which we are always on.

        <h2>Family Pool</h2>
        <p>
          This year, my parents suprised me and my brother with a pool for our
          birthdays. We had been waiting forever to get a pool because we love
          to swim and it's more refreshing to swim in a pool and not in a lake.
          It's the perfect size to have other family members join in and
          friends.

        <h2>Trying New Restaurants</h2>
        <p>
          I love eating and trying new foods. I am always searching for new
          kinds of foods to try and my favorite style has been Korean food.
          Korean food is very healthy, flavorful, and delicious. I highly
          recommend it. In this picture this was a meal called Bibimbop with
          squid meat and beef with a bunch of veggies and rice.
