    <h1>Hello, my name is Makenzie!</h1>
    <h2>Things about me:</h2>
    <h3>
      I am a freshman at
      <a href="https://www.mchenry.edu/">McHenry County College.</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      At first I didn't want to go to college but my parents encouraged me to.
      It's a big adjustment navigating through a new school and new software.
      But, I am super happy I applied because it's an amazing school and it will
      be a good experience.

    <h3>I went to Wauconda High School.</h3>

    <p>
      I had a hard time in the beginning of my high School. I stuggled with my
      social anxiety. However, by junior year and senior year, I made tons of
      friends and joined so many school activites.
    </p>
    <h3>I work at a daycare.</h3>
    <p>
      I enjoy working with kids because they are fun. My love for kids started
      when my younger brother was born and I was around littles. I want to be
      the best part of a childs day.
    </p>

    <h2>Things I enjoy doing:</h2>

    <h3>Listening to music.</h3>

    <p>
      I love music so much because it makes me feel refreshed. My therapy is
      music because no matter how I am feeling I can listen to all kinds of
      music. Music is so unique because of the creativity that is put into it.
    </p>
    <h3>Trying new resturants.</h3>
    <p>
      I love eating out because I love trying new foods. Over the years, I have
      discovered many generes of food that are my favorite. Some of my favorites
      are Korean, Japanese, and Mexican.
    </p>
    <h3>Getting my nails done.</h3>
    <p>
      Getting my nails done makes me feel that I am put-together. Without having
      them done I feel that my nails don't look good. It's something I treat
      myself to and I can enjoy them for some time.
