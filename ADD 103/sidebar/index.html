            Spring is the season of renewal and growth. As winter’s cold fades,
            temperatures begin to rise and days become longer. Plants start to
            bloom, trees regain their leaves, and animals become more active
            again. Many people associate spring with fresh beginnings, colorful
            flowers, and gentle rains. It’s also a time when farmers prepare for
            planting, and nature feels full of new life and energy. -ChatGPT-

            Summer is the warmest season, known for long, sunny days and outdoor
            activities. School is often out, making it a popular time for
            vacations, swimming, picnics, and travel. Plants and crops grow
            rapidly during this time because of the strong sunlight. Summer
            storms can be intense, but they help keep the environment healthy.
            The season is often associated with fun, warmth, adventure, and
            bright green landscapes. -ChatGPT-

            Autumn is the season when temperatures begin to cool and daylight
            hours start to shorten. Leaves change from green to beautiful shades
            of red, orange, and yellow before falling from the trees. Many
            animals prepare for winter by gathering food or migrating. It’s also
            the season of harvest, when crops like pumpkins, apples, and corn
            are collected. Autumn brings a crisp, refreshing atmosphere and
            marks the transition from heat to cold. -ChatGPT-

            Winter is the coldest season of the year, with short days and long
            nights. In many places, snow and ice are common, creating a quiet,
            peaceful landscape. Animals may hibernate or rely on stored food to
            survive the cold. People often stay indoors more, enjoying warm
            drinks and celebrating holidays. Despite the harsh weather, winter
            has its own beauty—sparkling snow, frosty mornings, and a calm
            stillness in nature. -ChatGPT-
