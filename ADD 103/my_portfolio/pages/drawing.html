            <p>
              This hallway drawing was done in a random hallway in MCC. We
              learned about the vanishing point in class and had to make the
              drawing look like you are looking down a hallway.

            <h2>Bones</h2>
            <p>
              In this project I had to create a bone, that I was physically
              looking at, and really had to highlight the lights in the bones.
              We used black prismacolore pencils and white. When doing this type
              of work you can never mix the two colors because that will make a
              gray color. Instead you can use the gray of the paper and/or
              closely line up the black and white colors together without
              letting them touch. This creates almost a 3D look!

            <h2>Charcoal Drawing</h2>
            <p>
              For this piece we are still focusing on darks and lights. We
              spread the charcoal from the top of the paper to the very bottom
              and scrubbed to make a smooth background and cover the whole
              paper. After that was covered in an even black color, we used an
              eraser to find the objects from still-life and keep them the
              bright focus of the artwork. After finding all the lights, I went
              back in with the dark charcoal to get the shading right.

              My professor was very creative with the still life in front of the
              classroom and in this piece we, simply with our pencil, and
              measuring the correct proportions in the objects, we made the
              shadows dark and kept the highlights the white of the paper.

            <h2>Monster Drawing</h2>
            <p>
              I made a monster drawing the week of Halloween. I used the same
              techniques as I did with the bones artwork, using the white and
              black pencils. I found random, creepy objects from the classroom,
              and drew them how I saw them.

            <h2>Ink Wash</h2>
            <p>
              Ink is very difficult to use. I had to mimic still-life still
              focusing on the lights and darks. I learned that starting very
              light first and then going in darker with the ink is the way to
              go.
